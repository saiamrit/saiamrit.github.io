Hi! I’m currently a MS (Research, Computer Science) student at IIIT Hyderabad. Until recently, I was working as a Research Engineer at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India, working on the MBUX Interior Assistant using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

I finished my undergraduate from Delhi Technological University (Formerly DCE) in 2017, with a degree in Mathematics and Computing. I have been lucky to receive mentorship by some amazing people including Dr. Ganesh Bagler, and Dr. C.V. Jawahar.

I love to explore different problems, especially in computer vision, and experiment with different domains frequently. Sometimes, it ends up in something useful, other times it’s a good learning experience. I try to share my random thoughts on my blog. When I’m not doing academic stuff, I may be spotted in a peaceful corner doing some sketching, gaming, reading, playing my guitar/ukulele, or even taking naps!

Have a look at my CV for more details!
